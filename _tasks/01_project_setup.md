# Task: Project Setup and Dependencies

## Technical Requirements
- Initialize Python project using `uv`
- Create project structure with standard directories (src/documatic/, tests/, docs/)
- Configure pyproject.toml with project metadata and dependencies:
  - Core: pydantic-ai, lancedb, click, httpx
  - Dev: pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Create .gitignore for Python projects

## Addresses Requirement
"I prefer to use Python with uv" and "I like using Pydantic AI, LanceDB, Click for CLI, and pytest" - establishes the foundation with the preferred toolchain.
