# Task: Quality Evaluation System

## Technical Requirements
- Create `documatic/evaluation.py` module
- Generate evaluation dataset:
  - Extract Q&A pairs from documentation
  - Create synthetic questions using LLM
  - Include different question types (factual, procedural, conceptual)
- Implement evaluation metrics:
  - Retrieval accuracy (MRR, Recall@K)
  - Answer relevance scoring
  - Citation accuracy
- Create benchmark suite with expected answers
- Generate evaluation report with pass/fail criteria
- Support regression testing for system changes

## Addresses Requirement
"Consider how to do some basic quality checks by creating some sample questions from the documentation and validating that results are similar enough to the expected result / basic evals" - ensures system reliability.
