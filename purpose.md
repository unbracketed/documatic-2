The goal of this project is to ingest the documentation from AppPack.io into a RAG app / chat with your docs.

The complete documentation should be ingested into LanceDB and using configuration, schemas, and embeddings that will work will for general Q&A type questions against the content of the docs. Use a good chunking strategy to capture document boudaries, headings, and structure. 

I prefer to use Python with uv.  

Consider how to do some basic quality checks by creating some sample questions from the documentation and validating that results are similar enough to the expected result / basic evals

I like using Pydantic AI, LanceDB, Click for CLI, and pytest

Create tool(s) and a pipeline that can:
1. acquire the source documents into a local directory from the repo
2. chunk and embed the content into a table(s); suggest and capture metadata about the source docs like title, section, etc
3. run indexing if needed
4. provide a basic CLI for chatting against the data, powered by RAG, vector, full-text, and/or hybrid search techniques

Favor simplicity in the implementation to start with; it's OK to implement as multiple tools or commands that each handle one piece
